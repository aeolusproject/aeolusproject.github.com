Installation for Fedora 16 (64-bit only)
----------------------------------------

   Installing Aeolus is very easy. Just type the following on your
Fedora 16 server:

    $ sudo yum install aeolus-all

   This will install the latest Aeolus stable packages, along with their
dependencies, on the system.

   If you feel adventurous and want to try the latest features,
look at [Aeolus nightly builds](http://mirror.salasaga.org/aeolus-nightly/).
