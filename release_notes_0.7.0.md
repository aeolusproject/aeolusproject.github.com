Aeolus community release 0.7.0 is now available from the latest release
repos. These notes contain a summary of the high points of the last
development sprint and point out significant issues that were not deemed
worthy of stopping the release.

Installation is very straightforward, with instructions on the website:

Packages are available for Fedora 15 x86\_64, Fedora 16 x86\_64 and RHEL

## Release Highlights {#releasehighlights}

-   Aeolus now licensed under Apache Software License (ASL).
-   Added Conductor support for the Event API. This API provides
    Conductor with a means for tracking system messages, such as
    instance changes.
-   Improved i18n in API error codes and messages.
-   Aeolus now checks the status on image builds and pushes from
    ImageFactory. This helps Conductor track image building, pushing or
    readiness for deployment use.
-   Security fix removes logging of sensitive SQL occurring with RPM
    installation of Conductor.
-   Aeolus now indicates the remaining provider content after deleting a
    single provider image.
-   Conductor now supports image imports with the web interface. This
    provides users with the ability to import an image from a provider
    via Conductor.
