## Release notification

### Automatic notification of new releases

If you'd like to be emailed about new releases of Aeolus, please add
yourself to the
[aeolus-announce](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-announce)
mailing list. ([archives
here](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/aeolus-announce/))  
This is a low volume mailing list, with restricted posting, purely for
announcements of new Aeolus releases.

## Mailing lists

### User friendly

For SysAdmin's and general (non-developer) users, the aeolus-users mailing list
is the place for discussion and to seek assistance.

[aeolus-users](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-users)
([archives
here](http://news.gmane.org/group/gmane.comp.cloud.aeolus.user)) ([and
here](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/aeolus-users/))

### Developers and technical

Communication between Aeolus developers generally takes place using one of the
two development mailing lists, and IRC (for real-time communication).

[aeolus-devel](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-devel)
([archives
here](http://news.gmane.org/group/gmane.comp.cloud.aeolus.devel)) ([and
here](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/aeolus-devel/))  
The main mailing list, used for everything except Image Warehouse.  
This mailing list has a moderate volume of traffic, and includes both
patches proposed for inclusion, and general discussion.

[iwhd-devel](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/iwhd-devel)
([archives here](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/iwhd-devel/))  
This is a mailing list specifically for Image Warehouse development,
and has a low to moderate amount of traffic.

**WARNING -** All communication sent to these mailing lists is both public and
archived, so don't use them for anything confidential. For confidential
matters, use the direct email contacts at the top of this page.

## Security related

If you'd like to report or discuss a security vulnerability in Aeolus,
please email aeolus-security AT fedorahosted DOT org. Emails to this
address are forwarded directly to senior project members, with the
contents considered confidential (non-public) unless specifically
mentioned.

For additional security, you can optionally use GPG encryption for
emails to this address. The public key is available
[here](keys/aeolus-security-public-gpg-key.asc "Aeolus-security public GPG key").

Someone **WILL** get back to you, though it could be 24 - 48 hours
(that's unusual).
