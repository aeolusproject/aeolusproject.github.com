The Aeolus Development Team
===========================

Aeolus is developed by many people, in many locations around the world.

There's a [Google
Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=208821202026111036470.0004a15803778082ac2c5&t=h&ll=-4.565474,9.140625&spn=176.477907,336.796875&z=2)
showing locations of several contributors.
