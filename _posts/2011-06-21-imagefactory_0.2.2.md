The Image Factory team is pleased to announce the release of Image Factory
version 0.2.2. Version 0.2.2 adds features and bugfixes needed to support the
next step in the evolution of Aeolus.

* VMware vSphere support has been added.
* Support for snapshots of EC2 images on EBS has been added.
* Importing images from providers has been added to both the command line and
  QMF interfaces.
* Explicit support for rebuilding images without having to respecify the
  template.
* Building and pushing images now supports multiple targets or providers in a
  single call rather than requiring one to repeat the call multiple times.
  (added in 0.2.0)
* Source has been cleaned up and DRYed out. This is an ongoing, iterative
  process.
