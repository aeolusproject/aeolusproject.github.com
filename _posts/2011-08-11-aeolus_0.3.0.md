This is a __signficant__ new release of Aeolus.

It is our first to use the [new, user friendly, web interface][1] designed by
Ken Keiter and Jonell Lay.

Additionally, this release brings __initial support__ for __VMware vSphere
4.1__, and tentative support for __Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization__ (RHEV).

Installation is very straightforward, with instructions on the website:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http://www.aeolusproject.org/get_it.html][2]

Packages are available for Fedora 14 x86_64, and RHEL 6.1 x86_64.

All testing and bug reports are hugely appreciated, directly contributing
towards the quality of Aeolus releases and future growth.

__NOTE__ - Although Aeolus is still some way from production quality, it is
suitable for testing. __Please don't use it with live data yet.__

__Full details are in the release notes here:__
