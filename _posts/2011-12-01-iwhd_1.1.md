### Bug fix

* __Fix for query response bug__  
  For a query like this:

      $ curl -H 'Accept: */json' http://H:9090/b/o/_attrs
	
  The response now includes an "object_body" URL of "http://H:9090/b/o/", which
  matches the XML-formatted one, rather than "http://H:9090/b/o/body". That
  same line now ends with a comma, too.  
  \[bug introduced in 0.91]

### Changes in behaviour

* __iwhd now rejects a --userlist file when its group or other permissions are
  set as readable or writable__
* __Request logging is reorganized__  
  Now, 2 messages are logged for every request. They report the method, path,
  requested and actual size, and the HTTP result code.
