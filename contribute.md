Help newcomers
--------------

If you already have some knowledge of Aeolus, you can help newcomers get
started by answering their questions on [#aeolus IRC
channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/aeolus) and [aeolus-users mailing
list](http://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-users).


Develop
-------

You can help us build Aeolus itself. It's best to first come to [#aeolus IRC
channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/aeolus) or [aeolus-devel mailing
list](http://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/aeolus-devel) and discuss
your plans with the rest of the community, so that your contribution gets
integrated smoothly.

Here's a bunch of helpful links:

* [Aeolus project](https://github.com/aeolusproject) and [Aeolus
  incubator](https://github.com/aeolus-incubator) on GitHub -- the center of
  the universe for every Aeolus developer. Here you can find source code for
  the majority of the subprojects (for details see [source code
  locations](source.html)). We also use GitHub for issue tracking and accepting
  pull requests.

* [Submitting pull requests](pull_requests.html) -- guide to Aeolus pull request process.

* [Aeolus dev-tools](https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/dev-tools) -- tools to
  help you set up a development environment for Conductor and CLI.

* [How to compile Aeolus](compiling.html) -- instructions for compiling Aeolus
  components on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS.

Please take a look at [issue lists](#report-issues) for particular Aeolus
subprojects to get inspiration on what could use some improvement.

Currently we package for Fedora and CentOS. If you want to package
Aeolus for some other distro, please let us know via [#aeolus IRC
channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/aeolus) or [aeolus-comm-mgmt mailing
