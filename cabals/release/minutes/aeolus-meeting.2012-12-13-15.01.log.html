<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:02:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> hi, sorry for the delay, kindergarten pick-up took longer then expected
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:02:43 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">is attempting to get reasonably recent Aeolus running on a VM</span>
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:03:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> np nice to see you, hope all the kids contained their bodily fluids in the car
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:03:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> jclift, we've an etherpad for that http://etherpad-aeolusproject.rhcloud.com/p/aeolus-upstream-deployment-notes
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:03:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I've personally installed imgfac, deltacloud and conductor on three separate F17 systems
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:03:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> following those notes and it should work with no issues
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:04:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> Ahhh, cool.  I didn't know (or had forgotten) about that link.
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:04:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">eggmaster:</span> pick up was done locally using a bobsled
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:04:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> haha
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:04:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> you can even install conductor on centos with the same instructions
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> Yeah, that would be optimal.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:04:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> also, to recap about my two weeks old actions
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:04:36 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">throws out the F16 vm</span>
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:04:45 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">boots up CentOS vm</span>
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:04:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I had to try to install deltacloud via gem and imgfac via pip (so that we could merge that into dev-tools)
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:05:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> currently deltcaloud can be successfully installed via gem and dev-tools _can_ do that for you
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:05:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> other than installing conductor
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:05:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> BUT
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:05:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> imgfac distutils don't work well yet
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:05:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:05:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> so we're forced to keep the RPMs for now
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:06:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Is it better to manually rebuild an F17 SRPM package of imgfac, for CentOS 6 for now?
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:06:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> but the guys confirmed they _are_ working on the distutils issue
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:06:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> so jclift I don't think that will be needed
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> cool, thanks for the recap on that, that is mostly good news
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:06:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> as long as we can put some pressure on the imgfac guys on getting distutils to work as expected
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:06:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> right.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:06:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">put pressure on the imagefactory guys to get distutils working as expected</span>
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:06:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:07:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> yeah, there is an open issue about that on github too https://github.com/aeolusproject/imagefactory/issues/165
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> Well, my timeframe for a result is "today", so that course of action's probably not going to work for me. ;)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:07:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I got a mini-patch merget into conductor, that requires right versions of gems to make conductor run on debian and ubuntu
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:07:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> merged
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">eggmaster has postgresql install via dev-tools working for f17 and RHEL</span>
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:07:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> ubuntu today, god willing
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:07:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> just 3 packages got build time issues
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:07:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> i've been focused on thor-cli and helping on postgres... within a sprint or two we probably will want to pull down thor-cli as part of dev-tools
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> apart from that conductor is running
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> then I have taken a look at the status of the thor-cli and the old cli
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:08:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> the bad news is: after TIM integration the CLI tool (aeolus-image) is NOT working
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> and noone is working on that ATM
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:09:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> eggmaster, rhel/f17 postgres installs looked good along with specifying sqlite
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> ah that is bad news.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:09:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> jstransk says that it is a 2 sprint of work
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:09:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so that means that we will have a feature missing in the release, that was previously there :-(
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:09:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">aeolus-cli busted with TIM integration, estimate from dev is 2 sprint effort</span>
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> Are you in contact with the debian-cloud guys about getting things running on debian/ubuntu?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:10:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> the guys planning the TIM integration seem to forgot about the CLI
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:10:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> no I am not
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> Sounds like you're doing actual integration work for it, so it would probably be super useful to put you in contact. :)
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:10:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> They're making patches as well, and are very keen to have them be accepted upstream.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:10:45 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">suspects there might be some duplication of work</span>
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:10:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> I would like to, but I am for 14 days trying to get costs merged for the release ;-)
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:10:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:11:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> k, I'll put you in contact anyway
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Well,
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:11:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> ok

<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:11:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> We shouldn't take on any work that puts our current sprint efforts in jeopardy
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> i.e. let's deliver what we're already committed to.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:11:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so what do we do about the CLI?
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rlandy&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> cli has been broken on f17 for some time so not sure it's a feature 'taken away' - at least not on that platform
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:11:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> the good news is that the CLI did not do much
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:12:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> it was just the image commands
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> I think we decided that delivering TIM integration was more important than a particular release date.

<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:12:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> mpovolny, well it is a logical fall out of the cli going through the conductor endpoints rather than forgetting...
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> See `aeolus-image &lt;command&gt; -h` for more information on each command
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:12:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> i.e. wasn't the consensus last time that we were doing a features-based release for this next one, and then moving to time-based releases.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:12:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> I believe it was, yes
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:13:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> I see no reason to deviate from that, even though this news about TIM breaking aeolus-cli is a bitter pill.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:13:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> also, imgfac bundles a broken cli too
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> fwiw, i don't think we should spend any effort updating the old aeolus-cli but rather adding image features to thor-cli
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> so if the only feature we get from aeolus-image is image building
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:13:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> ACK
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:13:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> we can point people at the imagefactory cli
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:13:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> well if jstransk says that it's 2 sprint work for 1, it might be a 1 sprint for two
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:13:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> ACK
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:14:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yeah, I reckon we get the tim v2 bit all working, so that we have openstack support at least _functional_.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:14:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> That gives people something they can directly try out and report bugs against, plus write patches for.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:14:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> he was also talking about making the existing tooling work against tim/new conductor btw.  I don't know if that same estimate holds for porting the functionality in a much cleaner way to thor-cli.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> mpovolny, ^^
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:14:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> We can do thor-cli as a near-follow-up
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> jstransk said that the estimate is the same for thor-cli
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:15:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so I would go for doing it there
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> hmmm...
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so we do not have to do it twice
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:15:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> mpovolny, yea, I'd definitely target thor-cli
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> thor-cli sounds like the better place to put effort
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:15:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> well from my ponint of view -- 6 weeks is a lot of time to get 6 command, but so far all my estimates on this project where wrong
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> 6 commands of aeolus-image
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> In any case, personally I am ok with delivering a busted cli and just documenting it
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:16:29 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">just wants openstack support of some variety happening that people can use</span>
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:16:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> nah, I suspect you are correct re: putting 2 ppl on will bring it in considerably.
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:16:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> agree
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">15:16:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> even if we do it in a "release candidate" fashion will be good enough for now
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:16:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> and do the proper release when thor-cli is ready.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:17:06 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">is happy with "sleazy approach" is "good approach" isn't workable</span>
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:17:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> s/is "/if "/
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">15:17:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> it would be relatively easy to do a 'z-stream' sort of add on to the release I think
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">15:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Aeolus 0.15.0  -&gt; 0.15.1
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">15:17:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">15:17:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> np
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">15:17:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> if it's just a new repo/tag for bootstrap.sh
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">15:18:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> In theory. :)
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">15:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Well, I can only theorize right now :)
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">15:18:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> we don't have the bits to do anything with :)

<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">15:32:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> Rather point to an existing deltacloud instance, the user can request that deltacloud is built from source with a given release tag and started locally:

<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">15:32:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> giulivo, yea, I'm just wondering/hoping they have some wrapper scripts around it via src.  Do the same things exist if you pull it in via gem?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">15:32:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> ACK
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">15:32:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I have not even found a way to install into /sbin from a gem
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">15:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> so if the release cabal thinks gem is better, that's fine.  just presenting information :-)
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">15:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> When we originally talked about using dev-tools to deliver a release, we were going to specify a set of tags and get everything from source repos.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">15:33:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> a have doubts that gem provides enough functionality to be used let's say "seriously"
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">15:33:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> I don't know what gems buys us here over that approach.

<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">15:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> IOW I am leaning toward 'all source repos, all the time'
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">15:34:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> but what are the advantages of building from source?
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">15:34:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> +1 to the src repo
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">15:34:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I don't see any compared to gem
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">15:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> that you can always specify a particular tag that you want to install
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">15:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> gem moves us towards the platform-agnostic codebase we're after
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">15:34:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> with gems you also can specify a particular version
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">15:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> I realize that's sort of just a different kind of pointer
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">15:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">eggmaster:</span> you can specify a version of gem as well
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">15:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> and the same is with distutils for python
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">15:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Though it sounds like we're still going to have to figure a way to "make it start" on each platform
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">15:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> but it is more consistent with what we're doing with the other repos
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">15:35:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rlandy&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> +1 for  platform-agnostic codebase
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">15:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> giulivo, I think it is a consistency thing as much as anything else.  If we install that via gem we are kind of favoring setup in a way that benefits say conductor or imgfac because we start making it easier to get src contributions flowing for only come of the projects.
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">15:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> also from a developer standpoint
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">15:36:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> not sure i buy that argument gem install is more platform-agnostic, deltacloud install from source is just git,  ruby and bundle commands
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">15:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> some hacker might want a specific upstream tag, not a release

<a name="l-239"></a><span class="tm">15:36:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> i.e. maybe they want to test some upcoming functionality in dc, factory, etc that is not part of a released gem yet
<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">15:36:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> Actually, yeah good point.  I meant in comparison to rpms.
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">15:36:54 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">shuts up about gem vs git for the moment</span>
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">15:37:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> so we're actually targeting end users I suppose
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">15:37:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> and I see much more useful to have all the components installed as gems or eggs
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">15:37:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I can update those easily
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">15:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I can be sure they'll ship with the same contents across different distros
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">15:38:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> hmm.
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">15:38:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> I can write my own start/stop wrappers around them if I need to
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">15:38:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> eggmaster, I'd move to seperate the dev_tools roadmap discussion from the actual release meeting if possible.  I believe gem vs src install can be an implementation time decision from the dev_tools team personally
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">15:38:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yeah
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">15:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> +1
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">15:38:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Yeah so I think the next set of actions are pretty good, get a sort of 'release candidate' list of components together, document what's missing.
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">15:39:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> giulivo, I think that is a good point.  It seems like we potentially have 3 things we are getting at here.
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">15:39:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> 1.  Release cabal's role in establishing naming/process around when to create tags for the various projects
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">15:40:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> 2.  Defining some amount of strategy around how much integration testing one can expect from an upstream release and making sure a platform exists for that to happen
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">15:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> 3.  Defining some amount of follow on things that might occur after we've verified a set of known good tags.  Presumably these would happen out-of-band/after the release itself.  (Thinking things like making sure the src all works together before doing a ton of work around eggs, gems, rpms, debs)
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">15:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> Does that seem rational/consistent?
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">15:43:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> does to me.
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">15:43:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> me too :-)
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">15:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">15:44:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yep, logical steps.
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:44:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Seems good.
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:44:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> So, from there..
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">15:44:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> morazi, +1
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:44:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Seems like we are on track with 1 &amp; 2 at least
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> if we have a list of components/tags, then dajo &amp; giulivo can start thinking more about how to deliver on 2
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:46:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> Thinking about it more, since we're doing git tags for the rest of our related projects... DC via git makes more sense than via gem.
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:46:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> consistency, etc.
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:46:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> I'd say Release Documentation and communication falls under 3 as well.
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">15:46:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> getting back to a point you made earlier
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">15:46:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> about ease of use for the user, gems/eggs/foo vs src
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">15:46:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> I don't think we need to make that a primary concern.
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">15:47:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> that seems more like an effort for someone who wanted to package this up for a particular distribution.
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">15:47:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> that's where I agree AND disagree.
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">15:47:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> well so do I :)
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">15:48:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> but please elaborate
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">15:49:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> I just want to explicitly draw the distinction that we're focusing on the src-installable thingee initially but there is some amount of user-friendly install that may happen as part of #3.
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">15:49:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> ack :-)
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">15:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">15:49:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> That makes sense.
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">15:49:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> and just make sure it is clear that by saying we want a cleanly installable thing for dev doesn't mean we discount potential users of the upstream.  It is just a follow on in step 3.
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">15:50:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> personally I think it can't get much easier than bootstrap.sh for installation. Maintenance I'm not so sure about.
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">15:50:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> jclift, afaik we're _not_ doing git tags for the rest of the related project ... it's the opposite, we install dependencies as gems, imgfac via rpm and deltacloud via gem or rpm
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">15:50:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> jclift, the _only_ thing we get from git is conductor
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">15:51:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> jclift, and the conductor's bits and pieces
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">15:51:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Heh
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">15:51:25 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">'s brain explodes</span>
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">15:51:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> giulivo, you mean in your current testing framework?
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">15:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> cwolfe_, and in your too
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">15:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> eggmaster, yep.  I like how we've gone with dev_tools.  We need to push to completion there and get out of incubation
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">15:52:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> cwolfe_, except in dev-tools you can opt to install deltacloud via sources
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">15:52:36 </span><span class="nka">* eggmaster</span> <span class="ac">notes the time</span>
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">15:52:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> +1
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">15:52:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> cwolfe_, but again that is only for deltacloud and only if you opt to do so as by default we expect deltacloud to be installed
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">15:52:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> right, you can opt to install it (which makes sense if you'd prefer to say, test a gem install of deltacloud;-)
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">15:53:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> cwolfe_, the thing is that I consider imgfac as deltacloud external projects
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">15:53:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> i think it is more of a documentation issue at this point
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">15:53:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> giulivo cwolfe_: Lets take this bit off line?
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">15:53:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Anyone have any obvious action items to put forth at this point?
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">15:53:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Agree, let's wrap up the meeting, we can't resolve this in 7 min.
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">15:53:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">15:53:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">15:53:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> But to be clear it is a debate totally worth having.
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">15:54:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">eggmaster:</span> There's only one way to solve it though.

<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">15:54:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> rofl
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">15:54:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> lol
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">15:55:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> so to me it looks like imgfac and deltacloud have already and intend to release and be developed as separate components
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">15:55:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> does anyone disagree with that?
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">15:55:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Take it offline.
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">15:55:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#endmeeting </span><span class="cmdline">?</span>

<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">15:55:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;giulivo&gt;</span> :( I'm sorry, I thought that was a topic for the release cabal
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">15:55:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span>  it is

<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">15:56:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> sort of.
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">15:56:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> So I do not disagree with that.
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">15:57:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> but I am still not convinced we shouldn't allow ability to use those components from source
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">15:57:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> perhaps a middle ground is possible?
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">15:57:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">giulivo:</span> i.e. optional source install?
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">15:57:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> yes, let's do that
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">15:57:53 </span><span class="nka">* cwolfe_</span> <span class="ac">secretly knows that means not changing anything</span>

<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">15:58:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> It would be interesting to try it for all components, and see what happens.
