<a name="l-2"></a><span class="tm">15:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ambot&gt;</span> Meeting started Thu Dec  6 15:01:25 2012 UTC.  The chair is eggmaster. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.
<a name="l-3"></a><span class="tm">15:01:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ambot&gt;</span> Useful Commands: #action #agreed #help #info #idea #link #topic.
<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">15:02:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> OK, first topic from the agenda...
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">15:02:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">shall we bundle templates with next release</span>
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">15:03:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> The general feedback seemed to be "good idea, please do that".
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">15:03:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> yeah
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">15:03:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> was there anything beyond what i saw in the email thread?
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">15:03:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> We'll need to update the templates that are there to be CentOS (for starters anyway).
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">15:03:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Nah.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">15:03:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so would I say, having examples that actually are guaranteed to fit the release is a good thing to have
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">15:03:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> And what, for the record, is the preferred implementation/method for delivery?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">15:03:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> but that should be tested
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">15:03:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> (if there is one)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">15:04:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> yeah, we want a set of known good examples
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">15:04:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> that get installed onto the system?  qe can definitely test them out if you throw them into a directory
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">15:04:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> a set of known good examples -&gt; a github repo with a tag (or branch) per release?
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">15:05:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> The "how to get it into Conductor" is something I'm not sure of
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">15:05:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> and running them through conductor/whatever should be part of the tests that developers do every day
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">15:05:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> Yeah, the tag of the repo is a good idea
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">15:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> yeah something like that
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">15:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Does anyone know how we'd load these templates (and prob matching deployables) into Conductor?
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">15:06:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> So, they're "ready to go" after install.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">15:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> theres a command line tool
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">15:06:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> aeolus-configure -p templates  (?)
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">15:06:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">15:06:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> aeolus-cli?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">15:06:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Ahhh yeah.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">15:06:53 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">uses the GUI :/</span>
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">15:06:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> but last time I looked it could do only a small subset of functions
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">15:07:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> I'd downvote aeolus-configure
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">15:07:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Maybe thor-cli then
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">15:07:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> yeah, it's not aeolus-configure
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">15:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I would expect the guys working on API to work on the CLI at the same time keeping it in par
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">15:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> imo we really want to slim that down and start moving towards aeolus-cli once we have a good foundation via thor-cli
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">15:07:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Is anyone interested in looking into which tool is best to do the "get it into Conductor" ?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">15:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> but that is probably not the case on this project ;-)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">15:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> ie. as an action item for reporting back next week
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">15:08:21 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">looks at mpovolny</span>
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">15:08:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> ?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">15:08:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> did you just say that you tried using aeolus-cli for this once?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">15:08:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> jclift, I'd propose that the answer is 'we need to build the thor-cli'
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">15:08:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> well, for now it is either the old aeolus-cli or rails console
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">15:08:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> i remember trying some aeolus-cli image sommands
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">15:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> and that it is a simple matter of getting it scheduled into the thor-cli at the next available sprint (or according to priority)
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">15:08:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> but it was like my first week here
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">15:09:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> subcommands
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">15:09:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> mpovolny sounds like he needs a refresher then
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">15:09:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">15:09:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">15:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> thanks :)
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">15:09:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I can take a look and report the status
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">15:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> I believe it is aeolus-image and its currently broken upstream
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">15:09:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> atleast from what qe has seen
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">15:10:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;dajo&gt;</span> actually, that was based on devtools using sqlite, once postgres is the default, it probably will work???
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">15:10:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so put me down, I'll collect the status of the CLI with respect to the API
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">15:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">mpovolny will collect the status of the CLI with respect to the API (importing templates)</span>
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">15:11:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> So,
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">15:11:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Do we want a separate git repo to host these, or
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">15:11:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">dajo:</span> probably :-)
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">15:11:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> do we want to include them in conductor on the release branch?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">15:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I suggest not
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">15:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> or something else?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">15:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I would put it unde conductor
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">15:11:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> under
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">15:11:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">eggmaster:</span> We already have a git repo to host these.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">15:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> too many repos
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">15:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> ok, where is it?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">15:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> https://github.com/aeolus-incubator/templates
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">15:12:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> keeping it close to the developers, having them eventually make the examples part of the tests
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">15:12:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> as a way to keep it up-to-date
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">15:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> I like that idea.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">15:13:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> thanks, I knew that existed, but tbh I haven't looked closely at it.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">15:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> didn't know where it lived off-hand, want it in notes.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">15:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> The original motivation for separating them out is something of a desire to be able to make a 'community' to exchange templates though.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">15:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yep.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">15:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> Thoughts on how to satisfy both wants?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">15:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> pointing admins to a template-only repository seems like a more friendly thing to do than a directory inside of conductor
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">15:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> And having them separate in no way stops us from having things "at hand for developers".
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">15:14:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> +1
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">15:14:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> agree.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">15:14:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> hmm, so maybe it could be used as a git submodule below conductor to have it at hand for the tests?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">15:14:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> So, it's a documentation thing then: upon release we create a branch there and point to it in the release doc?
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">15:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> perhaps there is a wrapper script somewhere in the dev tree (or utils tree) that is able to pull the templates from the github repo and run them through the command line?
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">15:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> s/there is/there could be/
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">15:15:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Part of the concept of having them as a separate repo, is so we could pull them "live" from that repo from people's actual installed Aeolus installations.  (ie over the net)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">15:16:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Moving that into a subdir of any other repo will just make that a nightmare.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">15:16:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> yeah I am all for a separate repo, otherwise we wind up maintaining copies on release branches
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">15:16:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yeah.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">15:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> they should be easily fixable in one place
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">15:17:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Anyway, lets just get them working on CentOS first, and we can stumble along a bit further as we get things working. :)
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">15:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> does the 'pulling them in' seem like something that could live in dev-tools?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">15:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> eggsmaster, yes
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">15:17:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> idk
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">15:17:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">15:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> &lt;cough&gt;curl&lt;/cough&gt;
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">15:17:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> eggsmaster, though dev-tools is only upstream at the moment
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">15:17:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> ok, so getting then to conductor (or the CLI tool) as a submodule the same way converge-ui is works with a separate repo
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">15:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> so it implies probably getting into having at least github tags in devtools per release
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">15:18:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> I'm not a big fan of the submodule approach here
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">15:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> yeah my thought was that if the import wrapper script (thanks morazi) lived in dev-tools
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">15:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cwolfe_:</span> Is that a bad thing?
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">15:18:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> then you'd have a per-release ENV variable saying 'use this tag in the templates repo'
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">15:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">eggmaster:</span> why? it keeps it a separate repo and can be handy for the devs at the same time; or not?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">15:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> ok,
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">15:19:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> we are talking about two separate things I think
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">15:19:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> submodule is fine for development.
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">15:19:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> git submodule
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">15:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> I'm just talking about delivering the set of templates for upstream release.
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">15:19:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> I see
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">15:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> ok

<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">15:19:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> i.e. an easy way to say 'this set of templates works with this upstream release'
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">15:20:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> (no idea if -t means "tag" tho)
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">15:20:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cwolfe_&gt;</span> eggsmaster, a separate wrapper script in dev-tools: yes, i think that makes sense but need to think about it a little more

<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">15:50:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> either that or we're just really popular and interesting
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">15:50:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> and they are highly motivated to get imgfac 2 out there and close the door on imgfac1 so I'd suggest we engage them as aggressively as possible and see how far we can get
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">15:50:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jprovazn:</span> Do you reckon imagefactory + tim integration into Conductor will be in decent shape by mid-jan ?
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">15:51:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> mpovolny, morazi: so about the coffeebreak discussion (and what I said on Tim calls before):
<a name="l-263"></a><span class="tm">15:51:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> Tim was developed against mock only afaik
<a name="l-264"></a><span class="tm">15:51:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> my initial tries with building images on some real probider (ec2) failed so far, this was caused probably by snapshot mode
<a name="l-265"></a><span class="tm">15:51:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jprovazn:</span> now say something positive
<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">15:52:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> but, Ian released patches which should fix problems with this build
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">15:52:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> we have rhev &amp; vsphere.  ;-)
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">15:52:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> so
<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">15:52:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> haha
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">15:52:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> I'm optimistic and I tend to belieive that next time I'll try to build image from conductor, it will just work
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">15:53:10 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">suggests "next time" + 5</span>
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">15:53:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> anyway, this is about testing imagefactory
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">15:53:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> But... close. ;)
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">15:53:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> optimists should be shot on sight
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">15:53:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> it's optimistic to think we could recognize them on sight
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">15:53:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> (i'd shoot myself many times)
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">15:53:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jprovazn&gt;</span> I can do all integration of Tim into conductor by using mock provider
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">15:54:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">15:54:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> How did that discussion about new lab hardware go from a few months ago?
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">15:54:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> jprovazn, mtaylor should have that as a high priority item from our side as well, fwiw.  If you get hung up on it, please feel free to keep raising the concern about ec2.
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">15:54:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> Did we get new lab hardware, and can we use it for testing stuff for the release?
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">15:54:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> (ie to help jprovazn and do testing ourselves)
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">15:55:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> jclift, we are presently stuck in ticket purgatory, but at some point we should have stuff
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">15:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">15:55:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> though it was my understanding that we already had at least an ovirt set of nodes out there somewhere...
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">15:56:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> This would probably be a good agenda item actually, instead of being brought up during another item
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">15:56:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> yep
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">15:56:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> btw we have ~5 min
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">15:58:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> I think what we need to do is communicate our idea of how we're going to release via dev-tools to these other teams
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">15:58:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> jclift, eggmaster yea, it is a little fuzzy where it sits.  I could see the argument for tech cabal should be hashing out exactly these types of problems, release cabal should be worried about the mechanics of putting together a release.  The overlap being, release cabal needs to know about the blockers that are coming up...
<a name="l-291"></a><span class="tm">15:58:31 </span><span class="nka">* morazi</span> <span class="ac">hushes for now</span>
<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">15:58:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> so let's put down that we have to closely watch how's TIM integration going on not only from the "is it done" point of view, but also "does it work" ;-)
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">15:58:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jclift:</span> and explain that that requires us to have a good awareness of how to identify their latest stable release in their repo.
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">15:58:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> that's well put
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">15:59:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> because we agreed (did we?) that a release w/o IM2 does not make much sense
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">15:59:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Yep, IM2 == requirement
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">15:59:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mpovolny:</span> yes, agreed
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">15:59:29 </span><span class="nka">* cwolfe_</span> <span class="ac">cheers</span>

<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">15:59:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> and let's move

<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">16:00:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> Agreed
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">16:00:29 </span><span class="nka">* jclift</span> <span class="ac">has submitted proposals that _require_ OpenStack support in next rel</span>
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">16:00:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> I'd ease up a little bit on that... and propose an agenda item for next time...
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">16:01:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> Does the release cabal propose a steady stream of time-based releases or does the cabal propose feature-based releases.
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">16:01:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> For this release... feature based.
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">16:01:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> :D
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">16:01:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> Well, I think the takeaway from brno was that we needed a certain set of features in the next upstream release.
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">16:01:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> If it is time-based, the goal out to be to minimize the amount of overhead involved in packaging up a release and really working to enable a more regular cadence that is more thoroughly tested regardless of what's in.
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">16:02:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jclift&gt;</span> <span class="hi">morazi:</span> k, lets make this an agenda item for next week
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">16:02:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mpovolny&gt;</span> well I would say that we have to do time-based releases with new features every time ;-)
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">16:02:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> going forward, we have several minor releases that should take advantage of the tooling around the major release.
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">16:02:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> put another way, I don't think anyone pressed on 'do you want a release' or 'do you want a release with XYZ in it'
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">16:02:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> i.e. that can be very time-based.
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">16:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;eggmaster&gt;</span> end of sprint (each)
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">16:02:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;morazi&gt;</span> I'd be interested to hear if folks would rather see something with the promise of more steady follow ons or not.
