##Project Overview

Tim is a Rails Engine responsible for Cloud image management.  It  allows clients to create, delete and upload images to a multitude of Cloud providers.  Tim builds on top of Imagefactoryâ€™s cloud abstraction layer.

Adding the ability for clients to store meta-data (used for searching and sorting) as well as versioning and support for access control.  Tim wraps all this up in a clean, simple RESTful API.
